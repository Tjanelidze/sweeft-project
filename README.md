# Sweeft Acceleration Project

Welcome to the Sweeft Acceleration project README! This project was undertaken by Tedo Janelidze, aimed at creating a dynamic website with advanced functionalities utilizing React, Vite, TypeScript, and various other libraries.

## Project Overview

The Sweeft Acceleration project focuses on developing a website that harnesses the power of the Unsplash API to fetch images dynamically based on scrolling. Additionally, the website includes a modal window feature that displays detailed information about each image, including the number of likes, views, and downloads.

## Features

- **Scroll Fetch**: Utilizes the Unsplash API to fetch images dynamically as the user scrolls through the website.
- **Modal Window**: Clicking on an image opens a modal window, providing detailed information such as likes, views, and downloads.
- **Search History**: Includes a history page where users can view keywords they have searched for. Clicking on a keyword renders the corresponding search results.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Used as the primary JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Employed as a fast build tool for modern web development.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type-checking capabilities to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
- **useQuery and useInfiniteQuery**: Utilized for efficient data fetching and pagination.
- **react-router-dom**: Enables navigation and routing within the React application.
- **styled-components**: Used for styling components with a focus on component-level styling and reusability.
